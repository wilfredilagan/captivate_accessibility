# captivate_accessibility
A script for Adobe Captivate 9 to make it more accessible

This repo contains the files needed to make Captivate more accessible.  This does not make Captivate fully accessible, but fixes various issues that are based on how Captivate was designed.  This script was created
for a launch of a Virtual Learning Enviroment, so some of the fixes may not work with all projects.

Fixes:

Adds a skip to main content link <br>
Makes links appear as a tags<br>
Adds H1's and H2's to each slide <br>
Attempts to correct tab order on each slide when Web Objects are on a slide
Clears value of textboxes<br>
